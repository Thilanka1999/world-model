# Potential Abalations

-   Shared flow estimator
-   MC-JEPA had only done regression for one side. Do it for both sides
-   Add a global similarity loss to the reconstuction loss
-   Supervise depth network in intermedate levels
-   Feed a laplacian pyramid of the feature pyramid levels to the depth decoder
-   Unify the flow and depth decoders
